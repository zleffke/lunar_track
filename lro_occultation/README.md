# lro_occultation
Scripts for simulating/computing Lunar occultation of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO).  Ultimate goal is to compute time windows and pointing data for when LRO is in view and is not blocked by the Moon.  These schedules will be used to make observations using S-Band radio receiving equipment.
